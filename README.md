# theSpacePark
a front end website for a space park. people could book tickets and check shows will be shown in the park

People who might look at the web site (Personas) with their reasons
1. Our main persona is a parent, considering the visit with their family, including children. They will be looking for family offers and will want to plan things upfront â€“ e.g. if and where they can have lunch, some with little babies will look for rooms to change their babies (diapers), some will also look for information about disabilities. They will be typically limited to summer and winter breaks and hence will want to plan the trip ahead, even at the cost of the price.
2. Our second persona is a teacher or a tourist agent. They will want to arrange the trip for their group. They will be an organized group, hence will seek for group discounts, information about bus parking, any additional information for the organized group. They will be typically flexible with their visit time, although some will still have their preferences (e.g. the teachers will be limited to the school year while tour agents will focus to the summer and winter holidays). Some will be looking for the information about disabilities
3. Our third persona is a young couple. They will typically study and have no children yet. They will be flexible with the visit time, but may be limited with funds, hence will seek for offers and plan their trip in the least occupied periods.
4. Our fourth persona is a senior couple. They have already retired and they enjoy their life by travelling and visiting interesting places. They will be very flexible with their visit time and they will not look for.
